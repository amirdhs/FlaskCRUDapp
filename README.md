- **Read**: View a list of all employees in a table format.
- **Update**: Edit existing employee details.

- **Flash Messages**: Success messages are displayed after adding, updating, or deleting an employee.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: The application uses Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the backend.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python.
